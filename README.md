# Solar System Gravitational Simulation

Python-based physics simulation that allows you to explore the gravitational interactions between planets within our solar system. The simulation accurately models the motion of the first four planets, based on their masses, positions, and velocities, providing a visual representation of their orbits and interactions.

**Requirements:** To run the simulation, you need to have the Pygame library installed. You can install it using the following command:

```
pip install pygame
```

**Running the Simulation:** To execute the simulation, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

```
python solar_system_gravitational_simulation.py
```

Make sure you have Python installed on your system before running the above command.
